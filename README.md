# DOS TCP/IP packet driver stuff

This repository contains random bits related to DOS packet drivers.



## Specifications

There's one common specification revision floating around the interwebs, 1.09, and one less common one, 1.11. Both were written and published by the former FTP Software, Inc. Both original documents have terrible pagination and are a pain to read. I have reformatted them and converted them to Markdown for easy reference.
